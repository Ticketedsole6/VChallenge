I chose those test cases to automate because they were the most complete in the Swagger documentation. Some of them lacked definitions (expected response, expected response code, etc.), so I didn't think it was worth considering them. Maybe they could be used for exploratory tests, but not for automation. I did the automation project with Serenity, RestAssured, Cucumber, Gradle, and Groovy using the Screenplay model. I organized the files into corresponding folders for easy understanding. The framework generates a report where you can check their functionality and results.
